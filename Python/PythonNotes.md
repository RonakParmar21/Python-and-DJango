## What is Programming
Programming is a way for us to tell computers what to do. Computer is a very dumb machine and it only does what we tell it to do. Hence we learn programming and tell computers to do what we are very slow at - computation. 
If I ask you to calculate 5+6, you will immediately say 11. 
How about 23453453 X 56456?

You will start searching for a calculator or jump to a new tab to calculate the same. 
This 100 days of code series will help you learn python from starting to the end. We will start from 0 and by the time we end this course, I promise you will be a Job ready Python developer!

## What is Python?

-   Python is a dynamically typed, general purpose programming language that supports an object-oriented programming approach as well as a functional programming approach.
-   Python is an interpreted and a high-level programming language.
-   It was created by Guido Van Rossum in 1989. 

## Features of Python

-   Python is simple and easy to understand.
-   It is Interpreted and platform-independent which makes debugging very easy.
-   Python is an open-source programming language.
-   Python provides very big library support. Some of the popular libraries include NumPy, Tensorflow, Selenium, OpenCV, etc.
-   It is possible to integrate other programming languages within python.

## What is Python used for

-   Python is used in Data Visualization to create plots and graphical representations.
-   Python helps in Data Analytics to analyze and understand raw data for insights and trends.
-   It is used in AI and Machine Learning to simulate human behavior and to learn from past data without hard coding.
-   It is used to create web applications.
-   It can be used to handle databases.
-   It is used in business and accounting to perform complex mathematical operations along with quantitative and qualitative analysis.

## Why Replit?
- Replit is very easy to share tutorials and code.
- You can easily fork this repl and continue learning in your own style. Video, code as well as text tutorial on the same page which makes things easy!
- For fellow teachers out there, you create a .tutorial folder to create tutorials using replit.


# Why I love python (And you will too...)
Welcome to Day 2 of 100 days of code. Let me start with a story! 
Back in my college, I used to learn C and C++ programming in depth, used to score good marks. I created a bunch of printing, conditionals and loop program. Now what? I wanted to benefit from the same
In my second year of college, I started working (I mean actually working in the industry) with the python programming language. I was not so good with it but I used to write code for a singaporean client and actually make good money without having to actually master Python. Harry then got curious and started working on his Python skills even more.
I then got into web scraping and trust me I made some good easy money on Fiverr just by writing some python programs and charging on per webpage basis to my clients ( I used to automate scraping)

I then learnt flask and got to work with Flask with a university professor abroad. Long story short, Python made a huge impact in my career.

## What can Python do for you?

I want to show you some python programs I created which will surely inspire you to create your own versions of the same as we progress through this tutorial. 
Do not try to recreate them just yet if you are a beginner and just started working on Python. We will make progress gradually trust me
